# SGrab
A terminal screen-capture program written in rust, powered by ffmpeg.
Probably doesn't support wayland at all.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ``cargo build --release``
3. Copy ./target/release/sgrab to a convenient place
4. Add said place to path.

**NOTE: SGrab assumes that you have ffmpeg installed. If you get any errors, please check if you have ffmpeg installed and added to path.**
